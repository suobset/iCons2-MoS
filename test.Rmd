## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(here)

set.seed(69)
randomNumbers <- sample.int(100, 138, replace = TRUE)

root1 <- here("data", "mbta_rapid_transit", "MBTA_ARC.shp") %>%
  st_read() %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>% # Weird coordinate system: dont question
  mutate(score = randomNumbers)

# Leaflet function from leaflet package which makes a leaflet map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(data = root1, label = root1$score)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
