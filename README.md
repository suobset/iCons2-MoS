Initial Plan is to just use this repository for the QGIS stuff, and the regular "iCons" repository under my profile for the webpage (coz GitHub Pages).

<a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons">Here is that repository</a>

Introducing Voronoi Diagrams:

JS Source for referral purposes only (scratch): https://github.com/suobset/suobset.github.io

Added some Jargon R as well.
